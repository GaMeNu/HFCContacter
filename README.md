# HomeFrontCommand notificator bot
## Made by GaMeNu and yrrad8

We made a bot to notify whenever an attack/missile strike/terrorist infiltration happens in Israel.
This bot requests the latest alarm history from the [HFC website](https://www.oref.org.il) and pushes a notification whenever it notices a change.

> Please note that the bot may **not always be up to date**! please follow the official [HFC website](https://www.oref.org.il) at https://www.oref.org.il for the latest and most up-to-date info and alerts.
